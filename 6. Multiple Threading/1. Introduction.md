# **📌 Java Threads & Multithreading — Notes**

## **1. What is a Thread in Java?**

* A **thread** is a **lightweight process** that performs a task.
* Threading helps execute **multiple operations concurrently** to improve performance.
* Example: Splitting a large task (like summing 5000 numbers) into smaller tasks and running them **in parallel** using multiple threads.

---

## **2. Why Use Threads in Java?**

* To make applications **run faster**.
* Allows performing **multiple tasks simultaneously**.
* Better **CPU utilization** — especially on multi-core processors.

---

## **3. What is Multithreading?**

* A Java feature that enables **concurrent execution** of two or more parts of a program.
* Designed for **maximum CPU usage**.
* Each part of the program executed concurrently is called a **thread**.

---

# **4. Types of Threads**

### **a) User Thread**

* Created by the application.
* Keeps the JVM alive until all user threads finish.

### **b) Daemon Thread**

* Runs in the background.
* Used for housekeeping (e.g., **Garbage Collector**).
* JVM exits when **only daemon threads** remain.

---

# **5. Thread Examples**

### **Single Thread Example**

```java
public class SingleThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Single Thread is running");
    }
}
```

### **Multiple Threads Example**

```java
public class MultipleThreads {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread("Thread 1");
        Thread thread2 = new Thread("Thread 2");

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        System.out.println(thread1.getName());
        System.out.println(thread2.getName());
    }
}
```

* Multiple threads run **in parallel**.
* If **single-core CPU**, JVM uses **time slicing**.
* If **multi-core CPU**, threads may run **physically in parallel**.

# **6. Thread Life Cycle (States)**

| **State**             | **Description**                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **NEW**               | When a new thread object is created, it is in the new state.              |
| **RUNNABLE**          | The thread is invoked with the start() method. The thread control is given to the scheduler to finish the execution.         |
| **RUNNING**           | Actively executing instructions.                    |
| **BLOCKED**           | Waiting to acquire a lock; does NOT use CPU.        |
| **WAITING**           | Waiting indefinitely (e.g., `wait()`).              |
| **TIMED_WAITING**     | Waiting for a specified time (e.g., `sleep(1000)`). |
| **DEAD / TERMINATED** | Thread has finished execution.                      |
