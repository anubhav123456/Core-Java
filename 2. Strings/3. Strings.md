# 📘 **Notes: == Operator Vs equals method**
---

## ✅ **String Class**
```java
String s1 = new String("Hello");
String s2 = new String("Hello");
System.out.println(s1 == s2);      // false
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true
```
* == operator is always used for reference comparison since s1 and s2 are two different String objects in heap therefore there reference will be unequal.
* Although equals method is also used for reference comparison but String class overrides `equals()` to comapre contents of two strings instead of reference.
