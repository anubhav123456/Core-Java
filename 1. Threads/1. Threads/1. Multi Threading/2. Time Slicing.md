# Time Slicing Algorithm
---

## 1. Why Time Slicing Is Needed

When a **process has multiple threads**, the CPU must ensure that:

* Every thread gets a **fair chance** to execute
* No single thread **monopolizes** the CPU

This is especially important when:

* There is **only one CPU core**
* Multiple threads are **ready to run**

---

## 2. What Is Time Slicing?

> **Time Slicing** is a scheduling technique where the CPU time is divided into small units called **time quanta**, and each thread is given the CPU for one time quantum in a round-robin fashion.

---

## 3. How Time Slicing Works (Conceptual View)

* Assume two threads: **T1 (Green)** and **T2 (Yellow)**
* There is **one CPU**
* Time is divided into equal slices

### Execution Flow

```
Time → | T1 | T2 | T1 | T2 | T1 | T2 |
```

* T1 runs for a short time
* CPU switches to T2
* T2 runs for a short time
* CPU switches back to T1
* This continues repeatedly

⚠️ Threads **do not run simultaneously**, but switching is so fast that it *appears* parallel.

## 4. Real-Life Analogy: 🧑‍🍳 One Stove, Two Dishes

* You have:

  * One stove (CPU)
  * Two dishes to cook (Thread T1 & T2)
* You:

  * Cook Dish 1 for 5 minutes
  * Switch to Dish 2 for 5 minutes
  * Switch back again

Even though only **one dish is cooked at a time**, both make progress.

👉 This is **time slicing**

---

## 5. Time Quantum

### Definition

> A **time quantum** is the fixed amount of CPU time assigned to a thread before it is preempted.

### Real-Life Analogy: ⏱️ Study Timer

* You study Math for 25 minutes
* Then Physics for 25 minutes
* Then Math again

Each subject gets **equal time slots**

---

## 6. What Happens During Context Switching?

When CPU switches from T1 to T2:

* Current thread’s state is **saved**
* Next thread’s state is **restored**
* CPU resumes execution

### Analogy: 📝 Bookmarking

* You bookmark page 10 in one book
* Switch to another book
* Later return to page 10 and continue

---

## 7. Time Slicing = Concurrency, NOT Parallelism

### Important Clarification

* Time slicing gives **concurrency**
* It does **NOT** give true parallelism

Why?

* Only one thread executes at any instant
* Others are waiting for their turn

---

## 8. What If We Have Multiple CPUs / Cores?

### Scenario

* Thread T1
* Thread T2
* Two CPUs (or two cores)

### Execution

* T1 runs entirely on CPU 1
* T2 runs entirely on CPU 2
* No switching required

👉 This is **true parallel processing**

---

## 9. Real-Life Analogy: 👨‍🍳👩‍🍳 Two Chefs, Two Stoves

* Two chefs
* Two stoves
* Each chef cooks one dish independently

No waiting
No switching
Faster completion

---

## 10. CPU vs Core (Important Note)

When we say **CPU**, it can mean:

* Different physical CPUs
* OR different **cores** within the same CPU

### Example

* Quad-core CPU = 4 independent execution units
* Can run 4 threads in parallel

## 11. Concurrency vs Parallelism (Quick Recap)

| Concept            | Time Slicing | Multiple CPUs/Cores |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Execution          | Interleaved  | Simultaneous        |
| CPU Sharing        | Yes          | No                  |
| Switching Overhead | Yes          | No                  |
| Type               | Concurrency  | Parallelism         |

## 12. One-Line Summary (Interview Gold)

> **Time slicing allows multiple threads to share a single CPU by executing in small time quanta, creating concurrency, while true parallelism requires multiple CPU cores.**
