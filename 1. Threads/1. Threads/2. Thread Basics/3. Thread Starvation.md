## Thread Starvation

### Definition

Thread starvation occurs when a **thread is unable to gain regular access to shared resources**, so it **cannot make progress** and remains stuck for a long time.

In simple words:

> A thread is *ready to work* but **never gets the chance** to execute.

---

### Why Thread Starvation Happens

Thread starvation usually occurs due to:

* **Too many active threads** competing for limited resources
* **Unfair scheduling policies** (e.g., priority-based scheduling where high-priority threads dominate)

---

### Real-Life Analogy (Food Example 🍽️)

Imagine a family sharing food:

* If there are **many brothers and sisters**, some may **never get food**
* The **eldest sibling takes food first**, then the next, and the youngest gets nothing
* This is similar to **high-priority threads always executing**, while low-priority threads starve

---

## How Thread Pools Help Prevent Thread Starvation

### 1. Controlling the Number of Active Threads

Thread pools **limit how many threads can run at the same time**.

* Fewer threads → less competition for resources
* Just like:

  * One child → always gets food
  * Three children → manageable sharing
  * Too many children → someone starves

By controlling concurrency, thread pools **reduce starvation risk**.

### 2. Fair Scheduling Policies ⚖️

Thread pools often use **fair scheduling**, such as **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**.

* Threads are placed in a **queue**
* Each thread gets a **turn**
* No thread can monopolize the CPU or resources

#### Food Queue Analogy

* All siblings stand in a **queue**
* One takes one item from the plate
* Goes back to the queue
* Next sibling gets a turn
* Process repeats → **no starvation**

---

## Summary

* **Thread starvation**: Threads don’t get resource access and cannot progress
* **Causes**:

  * Too many threads
  * Unfair priority scheduling
* **Thread pools prevent starvation by**:

  * Limiting active threads
  * Using fair scheduling policies (queue-based execution)

### One-Line Interview Answer 💡

> Thread starvation occurs when threads cannot access shared resources and make progress. Thread pools help prevent it by limiting the number of active threads and using fair scheduling policies so every thread gets a chance to execute.
