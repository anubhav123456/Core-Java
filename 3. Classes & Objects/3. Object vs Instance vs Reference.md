# 📘 **Notes: Object vs Instance vs Reference**
---

In Java, the terms **reference**, **instance**, and **object** are related but represent different concepts. Think of them as *different layers of how data lives in memory*.

---

### **1️⃣ Object**

An **object** is a real entity created in memory using the `new` keyword (or by JVM in special cases like String pool).
It represents actual data stored on the **heap**.

✔ It is a runtime entity.
✔ Contains state (fields) + behavior (methods).

**Example:**

```java
Student s1 = new Student();
```

Here, `new Student()` creates an **object**.

🧠 **Object = The actual thing stored in memory**

---

### **2️⃣ Instance**

An **instance** is a specific realization of a class.
Every object **is an instance of its class**.

**Example:**

```java
Student s1 = new Student();
Student s2 = new Student();
```

Here:

* `s1` → instance of `Student`
* `s2` → another instance of `Student`

🧠 **Instance = Any object of a class (focus on “class relationship”)**

> All instances are objects, but the term emphasizes the relation to class.

---

### **3️⃣ Reference**

A **reference** is a variable that **stores the memory address** of an object.
It does NOT store actual data—only the pointer.

**Example:**

```java
Student s1 = new Student();
```

Here:

* `s1` → reference variable
* points to an object of `Student`

If two references point to same object:

```java
Student a = new Student();
Student b = a;
```

* `a` and `b` are **two references**
* referring to **one object (one instance)**

🧠 **Reference = Pointer to the object in heap (stored in stack memory)**

---

### **📌 Memory Visualization**

```java
Student s1 = new Student();
Student s2 = s1;
```

| **Stack (Reference Vars)** | **Heap (Object)**    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `s1` ─────────┐            | Object@123 (Student) |
| `s2` ─────────┘            | fields + methods     |

* Only **one object**
* Two **references**

### **🔍 Quick Comparison Table**

| Term          | Stored Where? | What It Represents          | Example               |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Object**    | Heap          | Actual data entity          | `new Student()`       |
| **Instance**  | Heap          | Object as a member of class | instance of `Student` |
| **Reference** | Stack         | Address / pointer to object | `Student s1`          |
