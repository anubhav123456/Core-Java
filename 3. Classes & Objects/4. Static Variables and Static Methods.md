# 📘 **Notes: Static Variables and Static Methods**
---

In Java, the terms **reference**, **instance**, and **object** are related but represent different concepts. Think of them as *different layers of how data lives in memory*.

---

## ✅ **Static Variables**
- Declared by using the keyword static.
- Static variables are also known as static member variables.
- Every instance of the class shares the same static variable.
- If changes are made to that variable, all other instances of that class will see the effect of that change.
- Static variables are accessed by class name not by object.  
```java
public class BankAccount 
{
    // Instance variables - each object has its own copy
    private String accountHolder;
    private double balance;
    
    // Static variable - shared by ALL instances of the class
    private static double interestRate = 2.5; // 2.5% default interest rate
    
    public BankAccount(String accountHolder, double balance) 
    {
        this.accountHolder = accountHolder;
        this.balance = balance;
    }
    
    // Instance method - works with instance data
    public void displayAccountInfo() 
    {
        System.out.println("Account Holder: " + accountHolder);
        System.out.println("Balance: $" + balance);
        System.out.println("Interest Rate: " + interestRate + "%");
        System.out.println("------------------------");
    }
    
    // Static method to change the interest rate for ALL accounts
    public static void setInterestRate(double newRate) 
    {
        interestRate = newRate;
        System.out.println("Interest rate changed to: " + newRate + "% for ALL accounts!");
    }
    
    // Calculate interest for this specific account
    public void calculateInterest() 
    {
        double interest = balance * (interestRate / 100);
        System.out.println(accountHolder + "'s interest: $" + interest);
    }
}

public class Main 
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        // Create three different bank account objects
        BankAccount account1 = new BankAccount("Alice", 1000);
        BankAccount account2 = new BankAccount("Bob", 2000);
        BankAccount account3 = new BankAccount("Charlie", 3000);
        
        System.out.println("=== Initial State ===");
        account1.displayAccountInfo();
        account2.displayAccountInfo();
        account3.displayAccountInfo();
        
        // Change the interest rate using the static method
        System.out.println("=== Changing Interest Rate ===");
        BankAccount.setInterestRate(3.0); // Change for ALL accounts
        
        System.out.println("\n=== After Interest Rate Change ===");
        account1.displayAccountInfo();
        account2.displayAccountInfo();
        account3.displayAccountInfo();
        
        // Demonstrate interest calculation
        System.out.println("=== Interest Calculation ===");
        account1.calculateInterest();
        account2.calculateInterest();
        account3.calculateInterest();
        
        // Change rate again and see immediate effect
        System.out.println("\n=== Changing Interest Rate Again ===");
        BankAccount.setInterestRate(4.5);
        
        System.out.println("\n=== Final State ===");
        account1.displayAccountInfo();
        account2.displayAccountInfo();
        account3.displayAccountInfo();
    }
}
```

## ✅ **Instance Variables**
- They don't use the static keyword.
- They're also known as fields or member variables.
- Instance variables belong to a specific instance of a class.
- Each instance has its own copy of an instance variable.
- Every instance can have a different value.
- Instance variables represent the state of a specific instance of a class.
