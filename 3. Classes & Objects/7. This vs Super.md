# 📘 **Notes: This vs Super**
---

## ✅ **This vs Super**
- The keyword super is used to access or call the parent class members (both variables and methods).
- The keyword this is used to call the current class members (both variables and methods).
- this is required when we have a parameter with the same name as an instance variable or field.
- NOTE: We can use either of these two keywords anywhere in a class except for static elements such as a static method. Any attempt to do so will lead to compile time errors. 
---

## ✅ **This**
- The keyword this is commonly used within constructors and setters and is optionally used within getters.
```java
public class House 
{
    private String color;

    public House(String color) 
    {
        // this keyword is required, same parameter name as field
        this.color = color;
    }

    public String getColor() 
    {
        // this is optional
        return color; // same as return this.color;
    }

    public void setColor(String color) 
    {
        // this keyword is required, same parameter name as field
        this.color = color;
    }
}
```
- In this example, We are using the this keyword in a constructor and setter since there's a parameter with the same name as the instance or field.
- In the getter, We don't have any parameters so there's no conflict. Therefore, the use of this is optional there.

## ✅ **Super**
- The keyword super is commonly used with method overriding when we call a method with the same name from the parent class.
```java
class SuperClass 
{ 
    // parent class aka super class

    public void printMethod() 
    {
        System.out.println("Printed in SuperClass.");
    }
}

class SubClass extends SuperClass 
{ 
    // subclass aka child class

    // overrides methods from the parent class
    @Override
    public void printMethod() 
    {
        super.printMethod(); // calls the method in the SuperClass (parent)
        System.out.println("Printed in Subclass.");
    }
}

class MainClass 
{

    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        SubClass s = new SubClass();
        s.printMethod();
    }
}
```
- In this example, We have a method called ```printMethod``` that calls ```super.printMethod```.
