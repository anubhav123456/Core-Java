# 📘 **Notes: Object Oriented Pr**

## ✅ **This vs Super**
- The keyword super is used to access or call the parent class members (both variables and methods).
- The keyword this is used to call the current class members (both variables and methods).
- this is required when we have a parameter with the same name as an instance variable or field.
- NOTE: We can use either of these two keywords anywhere in a class except for static elements such as a static method. Any attempt to do so will lead to compile time errors.
