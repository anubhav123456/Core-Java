## Difference between `shutdown()` and `shutdownNow()` (ExecutorService – Java)

### `shutdown()`

* Initiates a **graceful shutdown**.
* **Does not accept new tasks** after it is called.
* **Allows already submitted and queued tasks to complete** execution.
* The executor terminates **only after all existing tasks finish**.
* Used when you want a **clean and safe shutdown** without interrupting running tasks.

### `shutdownNow()`

* Initiates an **immediate shutdown**.
* **Attempts to stop all executing tasks immediately** (by interrupting them).
* **Does not allow queued tasks to execute**.
* **Returns a list of tasks** that were **submitted but never started**.
* Useful when you need to **terminate execution urgently** and must know which tasks were left incomplete.

### Key Differences (Summary)

| Aspect        | `shutdown()`        | `shutdownNow()`       |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Shutdown type | Graceful            | Immediate             |
| Running tasks | Allowed to complete | Interrupted           |
| Queued tasks  | Executed            | Returned as a list    |
| New tasks     | Rejected            | Rejected              |
| Return value  | None                | List of pending tasks |

### Important Note

* Tasks interrupted by `shutdownNow()` may not stop instantly unless they **handle interruption properly**.
* Always check task interruption logic when using `shutdownNow()`.
