## Thread Life Cycle (Java)

A thread passes through **different states** from creation to termination.

---

### 1. **New State**

* A thread is in the **New state** when it is created.
* Example:

  ```java
  Thread t = new Thread();
  ```
* At this stage, the thread is **not yet started**.

---

### 2. **Runnable State**

* When `start()` is called, the thread enters the **Runnable state**.
* The thread is **ready to run**, but **CPU has not assigned time yet**.
* Multiple threads can be in Runnable state at the same time.

---

### 3. **Running State**

* When the **CPU scheduler selects** a thread from Runnable state.
* The thread is now **executing its task** (`run()` method).

---

### 4. **Timed Waiting State**

* From Running state, if a thread calls:

  * `sleep(time)`
  * `wait(time)`
  * `join(time)`
* The thread enters **Timed Waiting** for a specified time.
* After time expires:

  * Thread goes back to **Runnable state**
  * Waits for CPU to be selected again.

---

### 5. **Waiting State**

* From Running state, if a thread calls:

  * `wait()`
  * `join()`
* The thread waits **indefinitely**.
* It comes back to **Runnable state** only when:

  * Another thread calls `notify()` or `notifyAll()`.

---

### 6. **Blocked State**

* Occurs when a thread is **waiting for a resource or I/O operation**.
* Example:

  * Waiting to acquire a lock
  * Waiting for I/O to complete
* Once the resource is available:

  * Thread moves back to **Runnable state**
  * CPU may later move it to Running state.

---

### 7. **Terminated (Dead) State**

* A thread enters Terminated state when:

  * `run()` method completes execution
  * `stop()` is called (deprecated)
* Once terminated, the thread **cannot be restarted**.

## Flow Summary

```
New → Runnable → Running
Running → Timed Waiting → Runnable
Running → Waiting → Runnable
Running → Blocked → Runnable
Running → Terminated
```
