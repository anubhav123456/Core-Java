## Threads in Java – Notes

### 1. What is a Thread?

* A **thread** is the **smallest (fundamental) unit of execution** in Java.
* Threads allow a program to **perform multiple tasks concurrently**.
* They help in:

  * Building **responsive applications**
  * **Efficient utilization of multi-core processors**
  * **Improving overall application performance**

### 2. Thread Analogy – Baking Cookies

* Imagine **baking cookies** as a task.
* Your **mother baking cookies** represents **one thread**.
* If only your mother is baking → **single-threaded execution**.
* The entire baking process depends on **one worker (one thread)**.

---

### 3. Multi-Core Processor & Threads

* A **4-core processor** can run **4 threads at the same time**.
* This **does NOT mean only 4 tasks exist**.
* It means:

  * At any **specific moment**, only **4 threads execute in parallel**
  * Many threads exist, but they take turns using the CPU

---

### 4. Context Switching

* When there are **more threads than cores**:

  * CPU switches between threads rapidly
  * This process is called **context switching**
* Each thread:

  * Gets CPU time
  * Performs some work
  * Then CPU switches to another thread
* This creates an **illusion of parallel execution**

---

### 5. Benefits of Multiple Threads (More Cores)

* If **you and your sister join your mother**:

  * Now **3 people (threads)** are baking cookies
  * The task completes **faster**
* Similarly:

  * **More cores → more threads running simultaneously**
  * **Better performance and faster task execution**

---

### 6. Key Takeaway

* **Single thread** → One task at a time
* **Multiple threads + multiple cores** → Faster and efficient execution
* Threads enable Java applications to **do more work in less time**
