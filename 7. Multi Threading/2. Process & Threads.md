# Difference Between Process and Thread

## 1. Definition

### Process

* A **process** is an **independent program** in execution.
* It has its **own memory space**, resources, and environment.
* Every process has **at least one thread** (the main thread).

### Thread

* A **thread** is a **lightweight unit of execution** within a process.
* Multiple threads can exist **inside a single process**.
* Threads **share the same memory space** of the process.

## 2. Memory Space

| Aspect       | Process               | Thread                            |
| ------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Memory       | Separate memory space | Shared memory within same process |
| Data Sharing | Requires IPC          | Direct via shared memory          |

## 3. Baking Analogy (Easy to Remember)

### Process = Baking Cookies

* Baking cookies is a **complete activity**:

  * Getting ingredients
  * Mixing dough
  * Preheating oven
  * Baking

➡️ This entire activity is a **process**.

### Thread = Steps in Baking

* Each step (mixing, preheating, arranging tray) is a **thread**.
* One person (single thread) can do all steps **sequentially**.
* Multiple people (multiple threads) can do steps **in parallel**:

  * You → Mixing dough
  * Sister → Preheating oven
  * Mom → Getting ingredients

➡️ This speeds up the process.

## 4. Execution Behavior

* A **single thread** can do only **one task at a time**.
* Multiple threads allow **parallel execution** within the same process.
* Threads share context, so **coordination is faster**.

---

## 5. Communication

### Process Communication

* Uses **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**:

  * Pipes
  * Sockets
  * Shared memory
* **Complex and slow**
* High overhead (like calling mom’s friends in different houses)

### Thread Communication

* Uses **shared memory**
* **Fast and easy**
* Low overhead (like talking to family members in the same house)

## 6. Overhead

| Aspect            | Process                   | Thread                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Creation Cost     | High (resource-intensive) | Low (lightweight)      |
| Context Switching | Expensive                 | Relatively inexpensive |

* Creating a process means:

  * New memory
  * New resources
* Creating a thread:

  * Reuses existing resources

## 7. Isolation

| Aspect           | Process | Thread                     |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| Isolation        | High    | Low                        |
| Impact on Others | Minimal | Can directly affect others |

### Example:

* If mom’s friend (process) gets hurt → others may not know.
* If mom (thread) gets hurt → entire house (process) is affected.

## 8. Failure Impact

| Scenario      | Effect                                  |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Process Crash | Usually does NOT affect other processes |
| Thread Crash  | Can crash the entire process            |

* Threads share memory → one faulty thread can corrupt shared data.

---

## 9. Resource Allocation

| Process                               | Thread                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Fully independent resource allocation | Shares resources (memory, files, CPU) |
| Own address space                     | Same address space                    |

## 10. Key Interview Summary (One-Liner)

> **A process is an independent program with its own memory space, while a thread is a lightweight execution unit inside a process that shares memory and resources with other threads.**
