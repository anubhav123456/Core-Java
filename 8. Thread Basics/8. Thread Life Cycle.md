## Can a thread in `TIMED_WAITING` move directly to `TERMINATED`?

### ✅ **Yes.**

A thread in the `TIMED_WAITING` state **can move directly to the `TERMINATED` state** if it is **interrupted** and its `run()` method finishes execution.

---

## Key Concept

* A thread enters **`TIMED_WAITING`** when it calls methods like:

  * `Thread.sleep(time)`
  * `wait(time)`
  * `join(time)`

* If `interrupt()` is called on a thread while it is in `TIMED_WAITING`:

  * The JVM throws an **`InterruptedException`**
  * Control jumps to the `catch` block
  * If the `run()` method completes after that → the thread **terminates**

---

## Important Clarification ⚠️

> ❌ **Incorrect statement**:
> “If a thread is interrupted during *any* state whatsoever, it will throw `InterruptedException`.”

### ✅ **Correct understanding**:

* `InterruptedException` is thrown **only when the thread is in**:

  * `WAITING`
  * `TIMED_WAITING`
  * `BLOCKED` (in some monitor-related cases)

* If a thread is in **RUNNABLE**:

  * No exception is thrown
  * The interrupt flag is just set (`isInterrupted() == true`)

## Thread State Transition (Simplified)

```
NEW → RUNNABLE → TIMED_WAITING → TERMINATED
                   ↑
              interrupt()
```

## Example: Thread moving from `TIMED_WAITING` → `TERMINATED`

### Code Snippet

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        try {
            System.out.println("Thread going to sleep...");
            Thread.sleep(5000);  // TIMED_WAITING
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println("Thread interrupted!");
        }
        System.out.println("Thread finishing execution.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start();

        // Interrupting the sleeping thread
        t.interrupt();
    }
}
```

### Execution Flow

1. `t.start()` → Thread enters **RUNNABLE**
2. `Thread.sleep(5000)` → Thread enters **TIMED_WAITING**
3. `t.interrupt()` is called
4. JVM throws `InterruptedException`
5. `catch` block executes
6. `run()` method completes
7. Thread moves directly to **TERMINATED**

---

## Can a thread move to `TERMINATED` from *any* state?

### ✅ **Yes (conceptually)**

A thread can reach the `TERMINATED` state from **any state** **if its `run()` method finishes execution**.

But:

* ❌ Not every state causes `InterruptedException`
* ✅ Termination depends on **completion of `run()`**, not just interruption

> **Yes, a thread in `TIMED_WAITING` can move directly to `TERMINATED` if it is interrupted and its `run()` method completes after handling `InterruptedException`.**
