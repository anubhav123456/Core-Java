## When to Use **Processes** vs **Threads**

---

## **Process**

### What is a Process?

A **process** is an independent execution unit with its **own memory space**.
Processes are **strongly isolated** from each other, so failure in one process does not affect others.

### When to Use Processes?

Use processes when:

* You need **strong isolation** between different parts of the application
* Different components should run **independently**
* Stability and fault-tolerance are more important than memory usage

### Key Characteristics

* Separate memory space
* Higher memory consumption
* Higher creation and context-switching overhead
* More stable and secure

### Examples

#### **Web Browsers (Chrome Tabs)**

* Each tab runs in a **separate process**
* If one tab crashes, it **does not crash the entire browser**
* Uses more RAM because every tab has its own memory
* Chrome now optimizes this using:

  * Inactive tab memory unloading
  * Tab grouping
* When you return to an inactive tab, it takes time to reload because the process is restarted

#### **Other Use Cases**

* Image processing tools (Photoshop)
* Video editors
* Game engines
* Any heavy or risky task that should not affect others

## **Threads**

### What is a Thread?

A **thread** is a lightweight execution unit within the **same process**.
Threads **share memory**, making communication faster.

### When to Use Threads?

Use threads when:

* You want to perform **multiple tasks within the same application**
* Tasks need to **share data quickly**
* You want the application to be **responsive and performant**
* Memory efficiency is important

### Key Characteristics

* Shared memory space
* Lightweight and faster than processes
* Less memory overhead
* Failure in one thread can affect the entire process

### Examples

#### **Mobile Applications**

* UI thread keeps the app responsive
* Background threads handle:

  * Network calls
  * Data fetching
  * Heavy computations

#### **E-commerce Platforms**

* Multiple users browsing at the same time
* Threads handle:

  * Cart operations
  * Inventory updates
  * Payment processing

#### **Music Streaming Apps**

* One thread for UI interaction
* Background thread for:

  * Audio buffering
  * Streaming playback

## **Final Comparison Summary**

| Aspect         | Process         | Thread                 |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Memory         | Separate memory | Shared memory          |
| Isolation      | Strong          | Weak                   |
| Performance    | Slower          | Faster                 |
| Resource Usage | High            | Low                    |
| Communication  | Slower (IPC)    | Faster                 |
| Failure Impact | Isolated        | Affects entire process |

## **Key Takeaway (Interview Gold Line)**

> You can use **processes anywhere**, but due to their **high overhead**, wherever possible we prefer **multithreading** for better performance and resource utilization.
