## Exception Handling in a Thread (`run()` method) – Notes

### 1. What happens if an exception occurs in a thread?

* If an **uncaught exception** occurs inside a thread’s `run()` method:

  * The **thread terminates immediately**
  * The exception **does NOT propagate** to:

    * The parent thread
    * Other running threads
  * Other threads continue execution normally

---

### 2. Effect on Main Thread

* The **main thread is not affected**
* Even if a child thread crashes, the main thread keeps running unless explicitly stopped

---

### 3. Handling Exceptions Inside `run()`

* Exceptions should be handled **inside the `run()` method**
* Use `try-catch` to:

  * Prevent abnormal thread termination
  * Log or handle errors safely

---

### 4. Behavior in the Given Example

* A new thread (`MyThread`) is started using `start()`
* Inside `run()`:

  * A `RuntimeException` is thrown
  * The exception is caught using `try-catch`
  * A message is printed:
    `"Caught exception in thread: Exception in thread"`
* Meanwhile:

  * The main thread prints:
    `"Main thread is running"`

---

### 5. Key Points to Remember (Interview / Exam)

* ✔ Exception in one thread **does not crash the JVM**
* ✔ Each thread has its **own call stack**
* ✔ Always handle exceptions inside `run()` for safety
* ❌ Exceptions do **not bubble up** to other threads

---

### 6. One-Line Summary

> An exception in a thread’s `run()` method terminates only that thread, without affecting other threads or the main thread.
