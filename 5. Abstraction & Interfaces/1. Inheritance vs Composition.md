# 📘 **Notes: Abstraction & Interfaces**

## ✅ **Abstract Class**
- An abstract class's purpose is to define the behavior its subclasses are required to have, so it always participates in inheritance.
- Animal is an abstract class.
```java
class Dog extends Animal {} // Animal is abstract, Dog is not
```
- Here, Dog extends Animal. Animal is abstract, but Dog is concrete.
- A class that extends an abstract class can also be abstract itself, as I show with this next example.
```java
abstract class Mammal extends Animal {} // Animal is abstract, Mammal is also abstract
```
- Mammal is declared abstract, and it extends Animal, which is also abstract.
- An abstract class can extend a concrete class.
```java
abstract class BestOfBreed extends Dog {} // Dog is not abstract, but // BestOfBreed is
```
- Here we have BestOfBreed, an abstract class, extending Dog, which is concrete.
