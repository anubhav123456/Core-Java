## `isFair()` Method – ReentrantLock

### Method Signature

```java
public final boolean isFair()
```

---

### Purpose

The `isFair()` method is used to **check whether a `ReentrantLock` follows a fairness policy or not**.

---

### Fairness Policy in ReentrantLock

* **Fair Lock (`true`)**

  * Threads acquire the lock in **FIFO order** (first-come, first-served).
  * Prevents **thread starvation**.
  * Slightly **slower performance** due to queue management.

* **Unfair Lock (`false`)**

  * Threads may acquire the lock **out of order**.
  * Higher throughput.
  * Starvation **can occur**.

---

### Return Value

| Value   | Meaning                        |
| ------- | ------------------------------ |
| `true`  | Fairness policy is applied     |
| `false` | Fairness policy is NOT applied |

---

### Constructor Usage

```java
ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(true);  // Fair lock
ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(false); // Unfair lock (default)
```

---

## Example Code

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        
        ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(true); // fair lock
        
        System.out.println("Lock is fair : " + lock.isFair());
    }
}
```

---

## Output

```
Lock is fair : true
```

---

## Example with Unfair Lock

```java
ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(); // default = unfair
System.out.println(lock.isFair());
```

### Output

```
false
```

---

## Key Interview Points ⭐

* `isFair()` **only checks** the policy, it does NOT change it.
* Fairness must be set **during lock creation**.
* Default behavior of `ReentrantLock` is **unfair**.
* Fair locks avoid starvation but may reduce performance.

---

## Quick Summary

* `isFair()` → checks fairness policy
* `true` → FIFO thread execution
* `false` → higher performance, possible starvation
* Fairness is set **once at construction time**
