# ReadWriteLock in Java – Notes

## 1. What is ReadWriteLock?

A **ReadWriteLock** is a synchronization mechanism in Java that:

* Allows **multiple threads to read** a shared resource **concurrently**
* Allows **only one thread to write** to the shared resource at a time
* Ensures **no read and write happen simultaneously**

It is particularly useful when the application is **read-heavy** rather than write-heavy.

---

## 2. Why ReadWriteLock is Needed?

### Problem with normal locking

If we use a single lock:

* Even **read-only threads** block each other
* This leads to **unnecessary contention** and poor performance

### Solution with ReadWriteLock

* **Reader threads** can work in parallel
* **Writer thread** gets exclusive access
* Improves performance when reads >> writes

---

## 3. Real-World Analogy (Bus Seat Booking System)

* **Readers** → Users checking available seats
* **Writers** → Users booking a seat

Since checking availability does not modify data:

* Multiple users can **read seat availability together**
* Only **one user can book (write)** at a time

This perfectly fits the **ReadWriteLock** model.

---

## 4. Key Rules of ReadWriteLock

1. Multiple threads can acquire the **read lock simultaneously**
2. Only **one thread** can acquire the **write lock**
3. **Read lock and write lock cannot coexist**
4. Internally, there are:

   * One **read lock**
   * One **write lock**

At any time:

* Either **N readers**
* Or **1 writer**
* **Never both**

## 5. Java Implementation – Code Example

### Shared Resource Class

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;

public class SharedResource {
    private int counter = 0;
    private final ReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

    // Writer method
    public void increment() {
        lock.writeLock().lock();
        try {
            counter++;
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " writes: " + counter);
        } finally {
            lock.writeLock().unlock();
        }
    }

    // Reader method
    public void getValue() {
        lock.readLock().lock();
        try {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " reads: " + counter);
        } finally {
            lock.readLock().unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

### Demo Class

```java
class ReadWriteLockDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource sharedResource = new SharedResource();

        // Create reader threads
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
            Thread readerThread = new Thread(() -> {
                for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                    sharedResource.getValue();
                }
            });
            readerThread.setName("Reader Thread " + (i + 1));
            readerThread.start();
        }

        // Create writer thread
        Thread writerThread = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                sharedResource.increment();
            }
        });
        writerThread.setName("Writer Thread");
        writerThread.start();
    }
}
```

## 6. Sample Output (One Possible Execution)

```
Reader Thread 1 reads: 0
Reader Thread 2 reads: 0
Reader Thread 1 reads: 0
Reader Thread 2 reads: 0
Reader Thread 1 reads: 0
Reader Thread 2 reads: 0
Writer Thread writes: 1
Writer Thread writes: 2
Writer Thread writes: 3
Writer Thread writes: 4
Writer Thread writes: 5
```

👉 Order may vary due to thread scheduling, but:

* Readers read concurrently
* Writer updates exclusively

---

## 7. Waiting Queue (Fairness & Starvation)

### Scenario:

* Readers and writers are waiting in the queue
* If readers keep coming continuously:

  * Writer could get **starved**

### How Java handles this:

* `ReentrantReadWriteLock` manages fairness internally
* You can configure it as:

  ```java
  new ReentrantReadWriteLock(true); // Fair lock
  ```
* Prevents writer starvation

---

## 8. When to Use ReadWriteLock?

✅ Use when:

* Clear **reader vs writer** distinction
* Application is **read-heavy**
* Shared data is accessed frequently

❌ Avoid when:

* Writes are frequent
* Lock upgrade/downgrade complexity is high

---

## 9. Key Takeaways (Interview Gold ⭐)

* ReadWriteLock improves **concurrency and performance**
* Multiple readers → safe
* Single writer → exclusive
* Ideal for **caching, configuration, booking systems**
* `ReentrantReadWriteLock` is the most commonly used implementation
